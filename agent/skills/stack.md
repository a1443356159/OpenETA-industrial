# Stack

Use this skill as text guidance only. Do not treat `stack` as an executable
macro. This skeleton combines pick and place guidance while adding stability
checks before release.

## Recommended Tool Sequence

1. Call `observe` to identify the object to stack and the support object.
2. Confirm both objects and any obstacles around the support object from the
   current observation.
3. Call `sam3` to segment the grasped object or support object if visual
   boundaries are uncertain.
4. Call `grasp_pose_estimate` with the host-joined RGB, depth, intrinsics,
   complete target-mask artifact, camera frame id, and scene epoch when the
   object is not already held.
5. For an unheld object, follow the pick skill's explicit SAM3 selection,
   qualified grasp queue, host-owned compilation event, atomic `move_to`, and
   separate gripper-control sequence.
6. Use `move_to` and `gripper_control` for placement as individual atomic tool
   calls. The simulator controller owns reachability and path-collision checks;
   inspect each structured result and observe after every world mutation.
7. Before release, choose a pose that places the object's center over the
   support area and leaves gripper clearance.
8. Open the gripper with `gripper_control`, retreat with `move_to`, and
   call `observe` to verify the stack remains stable.

## Recovery Notes

- If the support object is too small, unstable, or tilted, ask for help or
  choose a different placement target.
- If grasp candidates are weak, return to pick guidance and acquire a more
  stable grasp before attempting the stack.
- If the stack shifts after release, do not immediately retry the same motion;
  observe, assess stability, and replan.
- Do not continue stacking from stale perception. Observe after every
  world-mutating tool call.
