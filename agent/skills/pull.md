# Pull

Use this skill as text guidance only. Do not treat `pull` as an executable
macro. For drawers, treat the handle as the grasp target and the drawer travel
as a short closed-gripper pull. Do not treat opening as a pick-and-place task.

## Recommended Tool Sequence

1. Call `observe` to refresh object pose, pull direction, support surface
   geometry, and nearby obstacles.
2. Call `sam3` if the pull contact region or object boundary is unclear.
3. For a drawer, visually select the requested handle, estimate a handle grasp,
   label clear handle geometry as `drawer_handle`, require the host-owned
   qualified-candidate compilation event, and follow the normal wrist-aligned
   contact and close sequence. The label selects
   only a candidate task strategy and is not attachment evidence. For other
   targets, choose gripper-width contact, hook-like contact, or grasp-assisted
   pull if appropriate.
4. Use `gripper_control` only when the pull strategy requires a specific
   gripper width or grasp state.
5. Call `move_to` to approach the contact pose. The simulator controller owns
   reachability and path-collision checks; stop on a structured rejection.
6. After close, propose an attachment probe from current agentview+wrist evidence.
   Drawers normally use a world-frame linear direction. Hinged doors may use a
   local 2-5 waypoint arc. The host freezes exactly 5 cm; execute only the returned
   move/trajectory, then call `assess_attachment_probe`. Keep the resulting position
   on PASS. UNKNOWN permits one fresh observation and one reassessment only.
7. After verified handle attachment, preserve the closed gripper and EEF
   orientation. Execute one short world-frame pull segment along the drawer's
   travel axis, then call `observe` before deciding whether to continue.
8. Continue with bounded pull segments only while the handle remains attached.
   Stop as soon as the official reward or a clearly open drawer state is observed.

## Future Dedicated Tools

- A future pull planner tool should output contact/grasp mode, pull direction,
  segment length, and expected object displacement.
- A future pull execution tool should manage contact retention or grasp state
  inside the tool backend and still return control after a short observable
  segment.

## Recovery Notes

- Keep each pull segment short; re-observe between segments.
- If contact is lost or the object rotates unexpectedly, stop and replan from
  the new pose.
- If the pull requires a handle or reachable edge that is not visible, observe
  from another view or ask for clarification.
- Do not infer success from motion command completion alone. Verify object
  displacement in the next observation.
